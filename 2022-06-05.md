### Previous meeting
- Very friendly atmosphere attended by many hackspaces from around the UK and the world.
- Lots of conversation, but this meeting will be more managed to stay on topic.
- Note that there was a round up of topics that people wanted to talk about:
  * Membership pricing and offering
  * Improving diversity
  * Health and safety / safety culture
  * Management structures
  * Insurance
  * Directors' mental health
  * Property
  * Funding

### State of HSF 
- HSF has been relatively inactive since the pandemic
- Concerns flagged that the group is inactive because it's unclear how to make decisions without active directors
- Counter argument that HSF lacks leadership, the directors are just managing the group and have stated they're open to ideas.
- Suggestion that HSF members ought to talk about where we're stuck.
- One member said that the group had proposed a paid membership scheme for spaces to create a board that could then appoint new directors, but this got stuck with one of the directors.
- Observations about lack of volunteers on the HSF website development to be able to finish this.
- Various members asked why we needed to have spaces paying for this when the space has a large surplus of cash.
- There was various conversations about how to spend money with ideas including/focusing on:
  - Staff to help get things going, admin, managing volunteers and leadership.
  - Finding new sources of funding.
    - Investing in purchasing assets like property that could be leased/rented back to a space to make income
    - Insurance service
  - Paid legal advice and templates.
  - Paying for training such as institute of directors.

### Mapping out topics and priorities
We used a [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1pnsPHiq8UzZ0RRJRM6VDFnavYuRTkmnScHCYUYBiQKo/edit?usp=sharing) to map out the existing (yellow) and new areas of interest (blue).

### Next meeting
Ian has agreed to chair the next meeting, to be announced ideally between 1-7th August 2022 on Zoom with a focus/theme of the HOM

### AOB
Tom agreed to reach out to the HSF directors about having a formal business meeting about unpicking the way forward to getting spaces to become members as it might be unlikely the current directors would want to hire staff and manage them.
